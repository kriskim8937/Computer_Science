## Assemblers
- fundamental functions tha any assembler must perform.
  - translatin mnemonic operation codes to their machine language equivalents, 
  - assigning machine addresses to symbolic labels used by the programmer
- 2.1 ifundamental operations performed by a typical assembleer
  - algorithms and data structures
- 2.2 typical extensions to the basic assem bler structrue that might be dictated by hard ware considerationss
- 2.3 discussion of some of the most commonly encountered machine-independent assmebler language features their implementations
- 2.4 important alternative design schemes for assembler
> difference between assembler, compiler, interpreter Assembler is a program that converts assembly level language (low level language) into machine level language. Compiler compiles entire C source code into machine code. Whereas, interpreters converts source code into intermediate code and then this intermediate code is executed line by line.
