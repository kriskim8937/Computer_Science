## Computer network
- How to send and recieve data over a global telecommunications network?
## History of network
- The first computer networks appeared in the 1950 and 60s
- They were generally used within an organization like a company or research lab facilitate 
- It makes exchange of information between different people and computers much faster.
- A second benefit of networks was the ability to share physical resources. 
- These relatively small networks of close-by computers are called Local Area Networks, **LAN**
- Although many LAN technologies were developed and deployed, the most famous and succesful was Ethernet, developed in the early 1970s at Xerox PARC, and still widely used today. 
- **Ethernet** In its simplest form, a series of computers are connected to a single, common ethernet cable.
- When a computer wants to transmit data to another computer, it writes the data, as an electrical signal, onto the cable.
